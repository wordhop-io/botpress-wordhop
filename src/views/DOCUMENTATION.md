With Wordhop, humans and bots can tag team on conversations and delight your customers 24/7.  Connect a Slack team to Wordhop and connect Bots to Wordhop.  You can then monitor bots from Slack and take over live. You can use your own human agents, or invite outsourced human agents to a Slack channel to collaborate with your bot on customer service.  Wordhop alerts a Slack channel when a human should take over for a bot and then opens up a channel for you to chat live with your customer.  Wordhop will automatically resume your bot when you stop engaging with your customer and maintains a transcript of all bot and human interactions with each customer.   Wordhop supports bots built on Messenger and Slack.  Connect a bot in minutes and Wordhop begins working immediately.
